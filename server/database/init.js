          `SQL Injection (SQLi) remains one of the most notorious and impactful web application vulnerabilities. Despite being a well-documented threat, SQLi continues to appear in real-world breaches due to insecure coding practices and a lack of proper input validation.
      
      SQLi allows attackers to manipulate the queries an application sends to its database. A simple payload like ' OR '1'='1 can bypass logins and expose sensitive user data. In this post, we walk through classic examples, use DVWA to test them, and offer prevention tips including the use of prepared statements, input validation, and least-privilege principles.`

      A simple payload like <script>alert('Hacked')</script> can lead to severe consequences if the application doesn't sanitize output. Prevent XSS with output encoding, using frameworks that auto-sanitize, and enforcing Content Security Policies (CSPs).`
